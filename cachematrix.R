## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeMatrix <- function(x=matrix()){
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  seti <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  geti <- function() i
  list (set=set, get=get, setinverse=seti, getinverse=geti)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheinverse <- function (x,...){
  i <- x$geti()
  if(!is.null(i)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data,...)
  x$seti(i)
  i
}
